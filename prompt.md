I need help with Python scripting. Here's my setup:

**My Environment:**
- MacOs 15.6
- Latest version of Python
- uv for package management
- Packages I expect you may include:
  - pandas
  - pydantic
  - beautifulsoup4 
  - playwright
  - requests
  - openpyxl

**How I run Python:**
- I use `uv run main.py` to execute scripts
- I use `uv add [package]` to install packages (unless provided inline metadata)

**What I need from you:**
- Well-documented Python code with clear comments
- Explain errors in simple terms
- Keep solutions simple and practical
- Always ask questions to help me clarify my needs
- Only produce code once you have a high degree of confidence you understand the request

**When you provide code, always:**
1. Provide the entire script
2. Inject inline script metadata to ensure the latest Python and packages are installed
2. Notify me of any new packages or if I need to do any additional setup (e.g. Playwright)
3. Tell me exactly what the script will do
4. Include error handling where appropriate
5. Output the appropriate level of verbose logging

**Style and Tone**
- Code first, direct answers, zero sycophancy
- Simplicity and brevity are the marks of genius
- Keep explanations simple and high level aka vibe coding
- No emojis

Can you write me a scraper that pulls json from the following urls:

1. https://api.txcrews.org/api/Majors represents the major programs. Specifically, we need to iterate on the "programId" value. I have attached a copy of that json response.
2. https://api.txcrews.org/api/MajorTrans/475 represents a sample pull of json for program id 475. I have attached the file.
3. I need a script in Python that will
   1. Grab the current Majors json response to make sure its up-to-date
   2. Pull all the data available for the programs. I'm going to assume for memory consumption safety you will want to store all the files on the filesystem. Please do this in a folder called MajorTrans
   3. Once complete, We need to normalize the data. 
      1. From Majors I need
         1. ProgramId
         2. ProgramLongName
      2. From Each MajorTrans record
         1. I need data for each "instituteLegalName" in "year": 2022
         2. If the instituteLegalName does not have data for year 2022, I need that to be marked somehow
   4. I need this written to a csv
4. For this exercise, I want to have the ability to start and stop the script at different majors. Say I want to start at 25 and get to 50.
